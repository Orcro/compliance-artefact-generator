# Compliance Artefact Generator Script

This script takes a dataset that meets the Orcro licence list definition, and produces generalized compliance artefacts that are suitable for use in an [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/) compliant program.

</div>

## Usage

The script requires an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) interpreter to run. Any version should be fine, but the script is tested with 4.1.3

[GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) is used to download licence texts, ensure that it is installed. Again, any version should be fine, but the script is tested with 1.21.3

> It is expected that everything should work from a POSIX compliant shell. But the script is only tested on [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

Two `.csv` data files are required as input: 

1- A licence list (with appropriate metadata) for a software project
2- [Scancode toolkit](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) output for the corresponding software project

Lastly, and importantly, some dependencies may be installed via a package manager (specific to the project). So you should ensure that all appropriate package managers are installed (such as npm).

The recommended way to use this script is from a shell:

```bash
Rscript generate-artefacts.R LicenceList.csv ScancodeOutput.csv
```

Generated artefacts will be placed into the directory that the command was run from. The licence list and scan results should be encoded in UTF-8 and be present in the working directory.
